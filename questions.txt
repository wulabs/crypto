1. We currently use createSessionCookie() and readcookie(). Should we also
   use eraseCookie()? If so, when? Do we write a UI for it? What happens
   if a user forgets the password? 
[Madhu]: Handout FAQ state that user will never change the key database password
once it is set.


2. There are 2 custom functions encryptString and decryptString. These 
   functions are used to encrypt the user password. What key should we
   use for this?


3. In the sample code, decryption is done only if the message is prefixed with
   'rot13:'. Do we also have a similar convention or can we always attempt
   decryption?

 
4. If all messages posted in the group are encrypted using the same
    key from the group->key table, isnt this similar to an OTP (multi-time-pad)
    [Wu]: Done.


5. We get a cryptic decryption error "getting length of unknown", if we have no key for the specified group defined.
[Madhu]: Fixed. Checking if keys[group] exists in Encrypt and Decrypt. If it
doesnt, we return what we got.
